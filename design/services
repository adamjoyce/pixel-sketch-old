Service List

1. Web Design

Website design is much more than just the colours and fonts of your pages.
A good-looking site is little use when plagued with confusing navigation or by
cluttered information.

At Pixel Sketch we have established a tried and tested design procedure to ensure we deliver
on your business' core aims.  We begin with thorough research and discussion of the target
market to fully understand your key goals.  The sitemap and page layouts are designed early on to ensure
users can intuitively find each page and key information is not lost through overcrowding.  Concept
designs are produced and used for clarification and feedback.  A developed design will follow and acts
as a true representation of the final product.  After further feedback and revisions the design
is then signed-off.
